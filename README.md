# plotterturtle

## Introduction

This is a small python module combining python's Turtle Graphics and the Chiplotle plotter library
It generates a .plt file that can be written to the plotter later.
Or it can drive the plotter right away (see "interactive mode")
Written by Thomas Rutgers for the WDKA Interaction Station
The used proportions are optimized for HP 7475A plotters in A3 format


## Installation

### Installing the chiplotle library
* First install pip. Open a terminal window, and type: **sudo easy_install pip**
